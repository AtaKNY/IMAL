The ImalContrat contract is a simple example of a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling digital assets such as parcels of land and leashes. The contract has a few functions that allow users to interact with the marketplace.

The Leash struct defines the properties of a leash, including the owner, type of leash, price, and whether or not it has been sold. The leashes array stores all of the leash objects that have been created.

The ParcelSold event is emitted whenever a parcel of land is sold. Similarly, the LeashPurchased event is emitted whenever a leash is sold.

The buyimal function allows users to purchase the native token of the blockchain that the contract is deployed on. The buyParcel function allows users to purchase a parcel of land that is listed for sale, and the purchaseLeash function allows users to purchase a leash that is listed for sale.

The repairLeash function allows users to repair a leash by sending ether to the contract owner. Finally, the addLeashOfType function allows the contract owner to add a new type of leash to the marketplace.

Overall, this contract is a basic example of a decentralized marketplace that can be used to buy and sell digital assets.
